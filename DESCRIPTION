Title: Bivariate Interval Censored Data Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Junyi Zhou
Maintainer: Junyi Zhou <junyzhou@iu.edu>
Description: This package is designed to analyze the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) with bivariate interval-censored event time data (no matter case 1 or case 2).
    Both marginal and joint CDFs are estimated through a spline-based seive nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using I-splines.
    The nonparametric test for the dependence between two interval-censored event times are included as well.
    By providing the observation time, users can obtain the estimated probability of observing event, marginally or jointly.
